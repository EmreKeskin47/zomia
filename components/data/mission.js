export const MISSION = `

The Zomia Center is dedicated to addressing the needs of non-state populations worldwide.

Since 2001, the number of civil wars across the globe has increased 30 percent, leading to a proliferation of ungoverned and semi-governed spaces. These include areas under the control of militias, insurgent groups, or other autonomous local actors, as well as communities affected by privatization or ethnosectarian discrimination. Such spaces are often difficult or impossible to access for state authorities and international organizations, and remain understudied. Their inhabitants meanwhile lack access to crucial legal and developmental aid, including primary health care and population-level approaches that target disease and inequality. The Zomia Center addresses this gap.  <br/>

The Zomia Center partners local organizations. The Zomia Center does not seek to replace government services, but rather collaborates with local community groups to help build sustainable and autonomous approaches to local governance. 

The core strength of the Center is its alliance of researchers and specialists. Currently living and working across Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Afghanistan, they have decades of experience in contested environments. By building and maintaining trusted networks, they ensure access to the data necessary for robust analysis, and help implement programs ranging from vaccination campaigns to legal redress from the victims of airstrikes. Researchers include physicians, journalists, anthropologists and ethnographers, collaborating under the guidance of acclaimed sociologists and political theorists. 

The Center's projects are diverse.
