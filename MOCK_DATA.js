const ArticleText1 = `In August 2019, Iraqi Federal Police showed up at the mayor’s office in Fallujah to expel ʿAissa al-Sayir, the mayor, who had long been a key player in the city’s politics. Citing voting irregularities, the Anbar Governorate deployed the police after Sayir refused to give up his post. The event attracted little notice in the international press, but within Iraq many observers believed that the ultimate mover in this drama was not the local government at all, but Muhammad al-Halbusi, the Speaker of the Iraqi parliament, and one of the wealthiest businessmen in Anbar. The removal of Fallujah’s mayor represented a changing of the guard in Sunni politics, as a new elite seeks to assert itself in the post-ISIS era.

The discussion of ISIS in Iraq often focuses on Sunni-Shia divides, but this tends to ignore the crucial role of intra-Sunni dynamics in preserving the peace. In post-ISIS Iraq, the Sunni elite have split, with one segment allying itself to Baghdad and reaping enormous benefits – for itself and for cities like Fallujah – while the other segment has found itself excluded from patronage. Those, like Halbusi, who prove willing to bridge confessional divides are the winners in this new Iraq, while the old Sunni elite who cling to pre-war alignments are the losers. Understanding this divide is crucial to ensuring a lasting political settlement.

The New Elite: The Rise of Muhammad al-Halbusi

Muhammad al-Halbusi is one of the most powerful Sunnis in the country, but he derives this status not from a grassroots base but rather by virtue of his alliance with the Fatah parliamentary bloc, which is led by figures linked to the powerful Iran-backed Badr Brigade. Hailing from the town of Garma in Fallujah’s northeastern outskirts, al-Halbusi belongs to the Halbus clan. Pre-2003, the Halbus was far less influential than Fallujah’s other tribes, and exerted little influence on the Baʿathist state. The clan also had few ties to the Iraqi Muslim Brotherhood, which in the late Saddam years was an important actor in Fallujah. After 2003, marginalised clans like the Halbus did not make up an important part of the mainstream anti-U.S. resistance; instead, it was jihadi groups like al-Qaʿeda in Iraq that recruited heavily from the ranks of the Halbus and similar lower-status clans.

In this environment, Muhammad al-Halbusi, who had a degree in engineering, distinguished himself from the majority of his compatriots by working openly with the Americans as early as 2003 on renovation and reconstruction projects. In June 2004, al-Halbusi’s firm, Steel Company Ltd., was one of many Iraqi companies sub-contracted to work on a $28.6 million water treatment facility in Fallujah. The project soon stalled due to the deteriorating security situation and contractor negligence; by 2005, FluorAMEC, the American firm leading the project, estimated that it would cost $51.3 million to complete the project. By 2011, this had risen to $107.8 million. By this point, Muhammad al-Halbusi had become a major player in Fallujah. Three years later, he was elected to represent the city in parliament.

The Old Elite: The Decline of ʿAissa al-Sayir

The political trajectory of Aissa al-Sayir, the ousted Fallujah mayor, was the mirror opposite of Halbusi’s. Understanding his rise and fall requires exploring the complex relationship between the Baʿth regime and Islamist movements before 2003. During the 1970s and 1980s, Saddam Hussein’s government carried out extensive repression of the Iraqi Muslim Brotherhood, sentencing many to death. However, by the 1990s the Iraqi president’s stance towards the group began to shift, especially as the regime looked to promote an alternative Islamist vision that could compete with, and be more easily managed than, Saudi-linked Salafism. In 1991, dozens of Brotherhood leaders saw their sentences commuted, and were eventually released. In Fallujah and elsewhere in Anbar, Brotherhood figures such as Abd al-Razaq al-Saʿadi and Makki Hussein al-Kubaysi, who had been operating covertly, began to proselytise in the open, often in conjunction with the Baʿth party’s Faith Campaign. (Al-Kubaysi was an associate of Baʿthist Faith Campaigner Subhei Samara’i, promoting pro-Ba’athist variant of Brotherhood thinking; ʿAbd al-Razaq al-Saʿadi meanwhile, brother of Brotherhood leader ʿAbd al-Malik al-Saʿadi, was close with ʿAbd al-Latif al-Humaym, another pro-Baʿathist cleric who was among the richest families in Anbar.) Many of these figures became key leaders in the post-2003 insurgency; Makki al-Kubaysi, for example, became one of the founders of the Association of Muslim Scholars, a body that funnelled funds to Brotherhood-linked insurgent groups such as the 1920 Revolutionaries Brigades and the Islamic Army of Iraq.

One of the leaders who emerged from this milieu was ʿAissa al-Sayir. Having graduated with the rank of Lieutenant from Iraq’s Police Academy in 1993, al-Sayir had solid Baʿthist credentials. At the same time, his tribe, the Albu ʿAissa, had contributed more members to the ranks of Fallujah’s Muslim Brotherhood than any other tribe. After 2003, ʿAissa himself became a high-ranking member of the Brotherhood’s political front, the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP). Many prominent IIP-affiliated figures who dominated Sunni politics after 2003, such as Rafa al-ʿAissawi and Khamis Khanjar, were similarly Albu ʿAissa tribesmen from Fallujah. Following the US invasion, IIP chapters throughout Anbar seized control of city councils, police departments, and the Anbar provincial council, liaising with the Americans while simultaneously funding the 1920’s Revolutionary Brigades, the Islamic Army of Iraq, and other insurgent groups.

In 2007, the IIP in Fallujah formed a new armed faction, Hamas Iraq, which joined the US-backed Sahwa – ‘Awakening’ – movement against al-Qaʿeda. Al-Sayir, who was officially serving as an ‘aide’ to the police chief, moonlighted as the commander of Hamas Iraq. Hamas Iraq is widely believed to have exploited the cover provided by the Sahwa to lead a campaign of arrests and executions against the IIP’s political enemies. For a brief period in 2011 and 2012, al-Sayir spent time in jail following a government crackdown on the IIP and other Sunni politicians such as Rafi al-ʿAissawi and former Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi.

However, following the re-emergence of al-Qa’eda in Iraq as ISIS in 2013, a rapprochement occurred between the IIP and the Iraqi government, which sought an Islamist ally to thwart the appeal of ISIS among Sunnis. In provincial elections that April, the IIP catapulted back to power throughout Anbar, regaining influence over the governorship, provincial council, and numerous other bodies. In 2015, al-Sayir was appointed mayor of Fallujah.

The Birth of a New Era

Though the rise of ISIS proved useful for the IIP, it paid far greater dividends for the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a massive umbrella body comprised of mostly Shiʿa militias that operated in partnership with – but not under the purview of – regular Iraqi army forces. Even the PMF’s critics acknowledged its indispensable role in defeating ISIS, a legacy that granted the group political capital during the May 2018 parliamentary elections. The factions closest to Iran united as the Fatah Alliance. Muhammad al-Halbusi was by now a rival of the IIP, who sought to monopolise resource distribution and exclude those outside their patronage network, especially with an independent power base like al-Halbusi. So he took the unusual step of throwing his lot in with Fatah, a pro-Iran party. The gamble paid off, as Halbusi was elected Iraq’s Speaker of Parliament, despite the fact that his party, Al-Hal Alliance, had won few votes.

‘We supported Muhammad al-Halbusi to become speaker of Iraq’s parliament,’ said Hadi al-Ameri, Chairman of the Fatah Alliance and the Badr Brigades. ‘He’s a man of his word.’ Throughout 2020, Fatah MPs have publicly defended al-Halbusi from attempts by IIP-affiliated officials to submit a vote of no-confidence and have him impeached. Al-Halbusi’s Al-Hal Alliance used such support to supplant the IIP as the new power broker in Anbar province. It has also benefited from independent revenue streams, such as that of Jamal al-Karbuli, a wealthy Sunni businessman from Masyab, a mixed-sect city in southern Iraq where the Badr Brigades maintain a strong presence. Both the Governor of Anbar that ordered ʿAissa al-Sayir’s removal, ʿAli Farhan al-Dulayimi, and al-Sayir’s replacement, Muwayyed Farhan al-Dulaymi, are members of the Al-Hal Alliance and owe their status to deals made by al-Halbusi in parliament.

Since al-Halbusi’s appointment, Fallujah has witnessed a massive reconstruction boom. Hundreds of new residential units have popped up. Officials are paving the city’s main thoroughfares, rebuilding the important al-Muwazafin bridge, and are working on the city’s water treatment facility. (This latter project is being paid for with a $285 million loan from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency in 2015.)

The rivalry between al-Halbusi and the IIP in Fallujah, rooted in old socio-economic cleavages, is now oriented around seeking to benefit from such lucrative contracts. Shortly before his dismissal, ʿAissa al-Sayir was rumoured to have met with Khamis Khanjar, a fellow Albu ʿAissa tribesman with historical links to the IIP and who, like al-Halbusi, has used his riches to influence national politics, making the two bitter enemies. Khanjar’s own party, ‘the Arab Project,’ includes in its ranks IIP figures such as Rafa al-ʿAissawi and Tariq al-Hashimi, targets of the government’s crackdown on Sunni politicians in 2011–12. Prior to his removal, opponents accused al-Sayir of stalling reconstruction projects in Fallujah in order to ensure that the city’s IIP elite won the contracts. However, since al-Sayir’s departure, al-Halbusi has become something of a ‘city boss’ in Fallujah, with companies linked to him and his Al-Hal Alliance monopolising funds pouring into the city.

Social media gives a sense of the reach of al-Halbusi’s patronage network. Fallujah’s mayor, for example, recently tweeted using the hashtag #Fallujah_in_the_eyes_of_Halbusi’s_men a video of two supporters standing on the city’s renovated main thoroughfare, praising their benefactor:

“We want to say thank you, Anbar’s number one hero of reconstruction, the architectural engineer, Muhammad al-Halbusi! And who else? Fallujah’s mayor, Sir Muwayyed Farhan al-Dualimi. Your positive touch [on the city] is clear!”
@moaedfarhan77

Rebuilding Fallujah has brought tremendous benefits for the city. That such efforts are linked to a political force rooted in a cross-sect alliance is a cause for optimism. Al-Halbusi himself has promoted his alliance with Fatah using just such a narrative, declaring that following after the horrors of ISIS, Iraqis are ready to move past confessional divides.

Yet in allying with the Badr Brigades and in marginalising the old Sunni elite, Halbusi and the new elite risk stoking resentment in Anbar – potentially creating fault lines that ISIS-like groups can exploit in the future. The mass graves dotting the surroundings of Fallujah, left behind by Iran-backed militias, remain unaccounted for. (Recently, for example, al-Halbusi refused to point fingers at the militias when a few dozen bodies turned up in al-Babil governorate, where many Sunnis had been abducted and killed). Tens of thousands who have lost their family members due to these militias remain without justice, or a truth and reconciliation process. Through such partnerships, Halbusi has added to the sense in Fallujah that these militias are able to operate with impunity. Meanwhile, the IIP continues to exert an influence. Its members proliferate the ranks of Anbar’s Sunni middle class, and occupy many bureaucratic posts in local government and in key industries. The best hope for a stable Iraq is a lasting political settlement, which will depend on the country’s resources – in terms of reconstruction funds and access to justice – being shared equitably across its society.

Earlier this month, as the Trump Administration announced that the United States would withdraw its troops from northern Syria, Turkey and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army factions launched an assault on the area, attacking the border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ein. Subsequently, the Syrian Democratic Forces, the predominantly Kurdish militia that had been backed by the U.S. since 2015, looked to an alternative partner that would protect them from Turkish forces. In a deal with the Syrian regime that was sponsored by Russia, the SDF agreed to allow Bashar al-Assad’s forces to enter a 95-kilometer-long strip adjacent to the Turkish border, between the cities of Manbij and Kobani. In return, the Syrian regime would help the SDF prevent the FSA from attempting a take-over of Manbij. However, just a week later, the deal now looks to be an opening for the regime take over the city itself. 
 
Regime Control in the Manbij Countryside
 
On October 13th, regime forces entered Manbij from the sub-district of al-Arima in the western suburbs—the first time since the regime entered the city since it was expelled in July 2012. Manbij has a strategic location as the gateway to the Euphrates region, and is home to about 200,000 people, which includes many internally displaced Syrians. The regime did not stay in the city; instead, they and the Russians conducted joint patrols in the northwestern countryside, adjacent to FSA controlled areas. Soon after, regime forces spread to twenty-three other villages in the Manbij countryside, from al-Jat village in the east all the way to al-Arima to the west.
 
In response, two days later, the Turkish Ministry of Defense and the Free Army announced the battle to capture Manbij city. The battle began from four directions, and after two hours, the FSA was able to capture three villages west of Manbij. But four hours after the start of the operation, the factions halted their advancement at Turkey’s request. 
 
As events accelerated, the American forces started to withdraw from their bases in Aun al-Dadat village north of the city, al-Asaliah northwest of the city, and al-Sadiya in the western suburbs. Within hours of their departure, regime forces stationed themselves at the strategic crossing near Tishrin Dam, east of the city, and more regime reinforcements began to arrive in western Manbij, adjacent to where FSA-controlled villages.
 
Background to Regime – SDF Cooperation: The Arima Deal
This isn’t the first time the SDF has been compelled to turn to the regime for support. In March 2017, Turkish-backed forces were marching towards Manbij from the northwest. Through the U.S. was backing the SDF, it refused to intervene in this to protect their allies, because these areas were located outside the range of the Coalition’s geographic purview. As a result, the SDF turned to the regime; the deal, sponsored by Russia, stipulated that SDF would facilitate the passage of petroleum convoys to regime-controlled areas, in exchange for the regime’s support in stopping the march of FSA forces. This resulted in the creation of joint checkpoints between the regime and the SDF in the sub-district of Arima and its villages. Two Russian bases were established in the area as well.
 
Tightening the Noose Around Manbij City
 
The current deal between the SDF and the regime allows Assad to exert a greater presence in an area he’d been unable to recapture for five years. On October 16th, American forces withdrew from the Qaraquzaq bridge, spanning the Euphrates river, which gave the regime and the Russian the opportunity to expand further east of the Euphrates, passing through Manbij to Kobani and Tabqa. There appears to have been an informal understanding between the Turks, the Russians, and the Americans to allow the spread of regime forces in the area spanning from al-Jat to al-Arima, which is considered the closest point to the city, in order to stop the potential waves of migration waves that would result from a regime takeover of the city. The regime forces are effectively closing off areas north and west of the city to the residents of Manbij. The area south of the city is also under the control of the regime, which is stationed about 25km way from the city. The east is closed at the moment, because of the fighting that is taking place over there, and because the regime has captured some strategic roads. Just outside the city, the Assad regime has stationed three regime personnel in each of the checkpoints east and west of Manbij city, in order to facilitate the passage of their troop columns The city itself is not under regime control--not yet, at least. 
 
Beyond a military show of force, the regime is also trying to intensify its political presence in and around Manbij. Last week, a Syrian and Russian media delegation visited downtown Manbij in order to organize rallies in support of the regime forces. The SDF soon dispersed the crowds from the public square and in front of the Military Council Headquarter located near the Flour Mills Roundabout south of the city. Furthermore, the regime tried to pressure the SDF to raise the regime flag in the city center and on top of government insinuations, which the SDF so far has refused to do. Similarly, on October 16th, it asked to open centers to reconcile with opposition activists, as it has done in other areas it has reconquered. This, too, the SDF has thus far rejected. As a result, the regime started shifting its strategy. At first, an SDF escort would lead a Russian and Syrian police patrol up the al-Arima road, located to the west of the city, to the village of Aun al-Dalat, to its north. Now, however, in order to convince the public that it has taken control over Manbij, its patrols are passing through the city on their way to Aun al-Dadat. In addition, the regime is trying to win hearts and minds through employees of its institutions (such as bread and electricity) who have been present in the city for the last few years. These individuals are trying to persuade their friends and neighbors that the regime’s takeover would be a welcome development.  
 
A City of Fear
 
Caught between the advancements of Turkey and the FSA on the one side, and the regime and Russia on the other, the civilians of Manbij are living in a state of panic and fear for what may happen. The city is home to those who defected from the regime’s military as well as those who were previously with the FSA. At the same time, there are a large number of youths who have lost their trust in the FSA; The rebels had promised that if the regime entered the city, they would invade in order to liberate them. They kept repeating this promise, through their media outlets, but have done nothing.
A complete regime take-over of Manbij will be a disaster—thousands of people will be displaced while revolutionary activists will oppose any regime presence. Just this week, activists called for and successfully carried out a general strike against the regime—hundreds of stores across the city remained closed for the day. 
 
To add more complexity to the matter:  some members of the Manbij Military Council, a the governing authority here, are blacklisted by the regime themselves, and they will likely also act to prevent the regime from advancing even further. It’s possible that, in order to keep the Assad forces from gaining more territory, we may see new deals or agreements in the near future between FSA and SDF. This may be our only hope. Otherwise, without a new agreement or pressure from Russia, the regime is unlikely to withdraw.

Since 2011, followers of the Syrian conflict have usually portrayed divisions in the country’s myriad opposition groups along ideological lines or according to the identity of their foreign sponsors. Such analyses usually attempt to make sense of local rivalries and opposition infighting by identifying conflicts between “moderates” or “Islamists” or due to the differing patronage networks of outside forces.
 
But this fails to take into account the extent to which rival opposition groups play to different social and class constituents, such as urban vs. rural and tribal vs. bourgeois, and it ignores how hyper-local divisions often had a greater hand in fueling discord than any other factor. 
 
One key example of how local divisions shaped political expression is in the rise of ISIS. 
 
Throughout 2013, ISIS adroitly exploited issues such as urban/rural and class divides, the influence of money in politics, the provision of basic services, criminality, and inter-communal rivalry. 
 
One area where we can see this dynamic clearly is in the northern city of Manbij. ISIS arrived onto the scene there in April 2013 when the city’s urban elite and a cohort of tribal dissidents were at each other’s throats over control of local revenue and the city’s infrastructure. In less than a year ISIS was able to pick off allies from the tribal camp and play on popular resentments towards the urban elite, eventually leading many revolutionaries to passively accept its final military assault on the city. 
 
Understanding ISIS’ ability to do so in one of Syria’s largest, most civically engaged cities is useful for extracting lessons that can shed light on how jihadist groups in other parts of the country have penetrated less politically developed areas.   
 
Hadhrani-Tribal Split
 
Almost immediately after its liberation, in July 2012, Manbij became irreconcilably divided between two political blocs representing communities whose distinct sense of identity was forged over the course of the preceding century.
 
The Hadhrani (i.e. urban, civilized) community is a caste of middle and upper-middle class families—in some instances extraordinarily wealthy deracinated Arabs whose ancestors allegedly settled Manbij in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These families benefitted from successive waves of urbanization in Manbij and other cities across Syria in the post-war period, particularly taking advantage of expanding retail, manufacturing and construction sectors. 
 
This success enabled them, gradually, to outpace, and at times marginalize, the rural tribal elites, who had derived immense wealth and status from large agricultural holdings during the Ottoman and French Mandate periods. Hadhranis in Manbij began to develop links with other provincial bourgeoisie in growing urban centers like Raqqa and Aleppo. The Hadhranis rapid political ascent was halted, however, with the Arab nationalist regime of 1958 and particularly the rise of the Ba’ath party after 1963, who favored rural constituents. From then on, Ba’ath party leadership circles in Damascus and Aleppo delegated political power in the Manbij to rural tribal chiefs, while the Hadhrani bourgeoisie’s struggled to compete with cheap goods produced by nationalized industries.
 
By the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, some Hadhrani families in Manbij gravitated towards the Muslim Brotherhood, whose armed insurrection against the Ba’athist regime appealed to souq traders in provincial cities. This experience would further reinforce longstanding commercial ties between Hadhrani families in Manbij with like-minded families in other provincial cities. These connections would coalesce over the years into resilient networks with links to important business sectors and religious groups in the Gulf.   
 
Following the outbreak of the Syrian revolution, some Hadhrani elites in Manbij utilized these networks to receive, channel, and distribute foreign assistance to influence the protest movement. Hadhranis became the main force behind the creation of a post-liberation governing structure known as the Manbij Revolutionary Council (MRC), which became the official ruling authority in the city after the regime’s 2012 withdrawal. During this period, Hadhranis were also among the most active founders and backers of local FSA groups in Manbij.
 
But there was a second group of elite activists in Minbej who soon challenged the Hadhranis for hegemony over the revolution. The top sheikhs of the rural Hosh tribal confederation (consisting of the Bani Saeed, Ghanayim, Aoun, Kharraj, and Ajlan tribes), and the Albu Banna tribe, were longtime regime clients — but second-tier tribal figures who had long been excluded from regime patronage had joined the revolution. Although these lower ranking rural figures were solidly pro-revolution, after liberation many felt that the Hadhrani caste was dominating the MRC and excluding them from the city’s administration. A confrontation between the two camps began to brew. 
 
The Seeds of Resentment
 
In December 2012, anti-MRC figures, including numerous civil society organizations, media outlets, and FSA factions, gathered to elect a new governing body, called the Local Council (LC). This body rejected the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Council, and included in its leadership a number of second-tier tribal figures of rural origin from the Hosh and Albu Banna. Throughout the first half of 2013, the key tension between the MRC and the LC was over the question of social services. The MRC had adopted a liberal, laissez-faire policy towards governance, imposing zero income, sales, value added, or commercial taxes on residents or businesses while choosing not to regulate key sectors such as fuel, agriculture, or imports. The LC and its allies, however, interpreted the MRC’s unwillingness to address problems in these industries — such as shortages and inflated costs of staple goods — as negligence. The LC began to make repeated, failed bids to assert control over key institutions like the grain silos and bread furnaces.
The Revolutionary Council also proved unable to rein in kidnapping and criminality that had become widespread in liberated territories throughout Syria. Pro-Local Council FSA groups in turn took it upon themselves to preserve law and order and establish their own courts and police organizations that undermined those set up by the MRC. 
Ironically, many of these groups were also the city’s most egregious perpetrators of criminality, in particular the Faruq Brigades, one of the LC’s most powerful supporters who mostly recruited fighters from the Hosh tribal confederation, and Liwa Jund al-Haramayn (LJH), which contained large cross sections of fighters from the Hosh and Albu Bana tribes. The Faruq Brigades and to a lesser extent LJH became the military weight behind the LC, allowing it to act as a counterbalance to the MRC. 
By April 2013, a cold war had grown between the Hadhrani-dominated MRC and the tribal-backed Local Council, leaving a divided city, ripe for exploitation under the right circumstances.
 
Here Comes ISIS
 
The forerunner to ISIS would first enter Manbij on 05 April 2013 to reinforce Ahrar al-Sham in its campaign to arrest the “Prince” a Faruq Brigade commander who was a notorious kidnapper. Allegedly, the Revolutionary Council had asked AHS to carry out the campaign in order eliminate its LC rivals, while Ahrar al-Sham—whose fighters mostly came from outside Manbij—viewed the campaign as a pretext to strengthen its presence in new areas. 
 
Before long, Ahrar al-Sham managed to arrest the Prince, landing a major victory for the MRC. Just days later, however, ISIS publically announced its existence in Syria, and members of its new chapter in Manbij began to cultivate close relationships with pro-LC figureheads. Soon, key Faruq Brigade supporters and other tribal figures threw their weight behind ISIS, who effectively replaced the Farouq Brigade as the most prominent backer of the anti-MRC camp. Months later, the Prince himself would escape from prison and strike up an alliance with ISIS as protection against the MRC and Ahrar al-Sham.
 
ISIS began to set up its own court system, with a penchant for extreme violence that made it an effective and feared force in the city. The group began to employ LC activists to renew calls for the MRC to relinquish control of local grain silos, bread furnaces, and other key facilities. One by one, with some popular support, ISIS began to assert direct control over them. 
 
When MRC-ISIS tensions came to a head in January 2014, the Islamic State was able to convince numerous FSA groups — including the Prince’s Faruq Brigades — to adopt an official stance of neutrality, sidelining a key section of the city’s armed factions. Yet following its takeover, ISIS would go on to arrest and detain many of those same pro-LC forces. The Hadhrani-tribal split had been one of the defining features of revolutionary Manbij, but in the end, both sides would lose everything.

Robert Kluijver (Cyprus, 1968) is an international relations specialist based in Addis Ababa. He is currently writing a PhD at Sciences Po in Paris on ‘International Intervention and State-Building in Somalia’. www.robertk.space

In late June 2018 the Somali insurgent movement Al-Shabaab announced a ban on plastic bags, citing environmental concerns and impact on livestock. The few international media outlets that reported on this development, as well as most social media commentary, immediately ridiculed the decision. Rukmini Callimachi of the New York Times, for example, cited mocking tweets calling al-Shabaab the world’s “first eco-friendly terrorist group.”
 
Such coverage assumes that all al-Shabaab media statements are mere propaganda efforts. However, many al-Shabaab announcements, especially those made on somalimemo.net and Radio Andalus in the Somali language, are meant primarily for those living under their control, and well as those in their own movement. For example, in my travels through Somalia, I’ve noticed extensive plastic bag pollution. The leading cause of death for camels in the United Arab Emirates is plastic bags (see an article in The National or the short analysis here), and undoubtedly they cause many deaths in Somalia too. Camel raising is a main source of wealth in Somalia. So a ban on plastic bags, whoever declares it, should be greeted with relief — and likely is, by al-Shabaab’s constituents.
 
Of course, many al-Shabaab claims should not be taken seriously, especially those related to their military endeavors. But the group is also governing territory, and we should look at such announcements in this light. 
 
Eight months after the ban, al-Shabaab appears to be strictly enforcing it, as they do all their regulations. The plastic bag ban is just one aspect of a more extensive governance system that has received insufficient attention. Interviews I conducted in Mogadishu this year revealed a consensus, even among government advisers, that besides maintaining law and order, Al-Shabaab has built up a good record on tax collection, financial management, and the provision of justice. As Hussein Sheikh Ali, former deputy head of the National Intelligence and Security Agency, and founder/director of the Hiraal Institute, a security research institute, notes, al-Shabaab probably out-performs most sub-Saharan African countries in these fields. 
 
Public administration 
 
Al-Shabaab’s finances have come under close scrutiny by the United Nations and independent Somali researchers; both have concluded that the insurgent group raises its required resources locally, mostly through taxation. Al-Shabaab collects taxes not only in the south-central areas of Somalia they directly control, but in all the neighboring cities as well, including Mogadishu. They have a sophisticated and predictable taxation system, including reliable financial transfers, careful bookkeeping, and personnel monitoring. There appears to be little corruption because tight monitoring systems reinforce the internal dynamics within the group, which strives to be seen as “clean.” The tax is used to pay civil administrators and security forces, who receive a regular salary according to a rationalized scale. Al-Shabaab mainly uses its resources to finance the war against the government, but at least some funding is reinvested in communities for small-scale development (e.g. water pumps and irrigation channels), schools, and law and order. Administrative overheads are low.
 
In contrast, despite the federal government’s commitment to building a well-functioning state, civil servants and soldiers working for the government are often not paid their salaries. As a result, they must extract their income from the local population by whatever means available. Businessmen generally prefer to rout their wares through Al-Shabaab territories, as their drivers only pay tax once and obtain a receipt which they can present as proof at other al-Shabaab checkpoints. On a government road, checkpoints proliferate — manned by soldiers, clan militias, police and intelligence forces. Cach collect their own “taxes.” This revenue obviously does not make it to the coffers of the public administration.
 
Justice
 
Even some of Somalis working in government are positive about al-Shabaab’s justice system. The formal government court system is mostly dysfunctional, and, despite the presence of a few honest judges, it mainly works through bribes – whoever pays more wins the case. In contrast, the insurgents run a professional judiciary. Criminal and civilian cases are heard in a public court. Mogadishu residents travel to the Islamic courts in Afgooye, a district on the outskirts of the capital almost entirely controlled by al-Shabaab, to seek redress on any matter, even domestic cases. Cases are dealt with immediately and, most importantly, decisions are enforced. Women may expect fair treatment within the parameters of the militants’ narrow interpretation of sharia law.
 
A typical case: Abdi returns to Mogadishu from the Gulf, where he is a successful businessman, to find his property he wants to develop occupied by Bashir and his family, who moved there during the war after their own house was destroyed. Abdi first turns to the district court but finds out that they have a few months backlog and that he will need to pay a hefty bribe to get his case handled, and even more for a favourable outcome because Bashir comes from a locally powerful clan. Abdi then gets in touch with Al Shabaab, and they refer him to the court in Afgooye where he must bring his documents and present his case. The militants ask him for Bashir’s contact details. They call Bashir, inform him of the case brought against him, and summon him to come to court. If Bashir ignores the summon, Al Shabaab will increase the pressure, typically threatening him. If the defendant cannot come to court for other reasons such as infirmity, AS will send a team from the court to hear his side of the story and collect evidence.
 
The judge considers the claims and the evidence from both sides, and then arrives at the verdict.  His ruling is that Abdi has right to the property but that, given that Bashir has lived there with his family for ten years and is poor, Abdi will have to find alternative housing for Bashir first. Abdi and Bashir must apply the ruling immediately. Non-compliance is swiftly and decidedly punished. However, if one of the parties appeals the decision, the case can be taken to the appeals court. 
 
This kind of Solomonic judgment intends to keep peace rather than uphold formal law. In the formal court system, the property deed might have been enough and there would be no requirement to relocate the occupying family. To a jurist trained in Western law, Al Shabaab’s legal system is full of flaws, and the pressure to deal with cases quickly leads to some sloppy rulings, but their courts do serve a social purpose efficiently.
 
Humanitarian aid
 
Two years ago, the UN warned of impending famine in the Horn of Africa and estimated that a large percentage of the population of South-Central Somalia was in acute danger of malnutrition. The UN organised the delivery of water, food and non-food aid and has since congratulated itself on having prevented a famine. What it does not mention, is that most potential drought victims in South Central Somalia live in Al Shabaab controlled areas, inaccessible to international aid. Although some of these came to camps run by international aid agencies in government-controlled areas, many others remained in their places of residence and survived the drought there.
 
Al Shabaab is against food aid because they say it ruins local food markets. They have suggested buying produce from Somali farmers and using local trade networks to import additionally required food instead of dumping Western surpluses. Given the strict international counter-terrorist financing laws, that is not an option for donors and aid organisations. It has been impossible for NGOs to start new projects in AS areas as that would entail dealing directly with ‘terrorists’. In the framework of the Global War on Terror, supporting farmers and businesses in Al Shabaab-controlled areas is tantamount to supporting terrorism.
 
In 2011-2012 a quarter million Somalis died because of a drought-induced famine. Back then, many of the victims lived in Al Shabaab-controlled areas; the militants, who had just made aid refusal a policy, suffered a major setback in popularity. In 2017, Al Shabaab organised its own aid operation, supported by private charities from the Gulf who do not fear the long arm of Western counter-terror institutions. See the BBC report here. There were almost no deaths due to the drought. Al Shabaab performed at least as well as the UN.
 
No social contract
 
This does not mean that Somalis want to be ruled by Al Shabaab. While the organisation may run an efficient administration, they also run an oppressive security intelligence apparatus with rampant human rights abuses that tyrannizes the local populace. When clan elders fail to make peace among their people, or refuse to provide fighters with guns for the war, they can be jailed and beaten mercilessly, even killed. Spying accusations are heard in a military court and can elicit capital punishment. 
 
What Somalis most hate about Al Shabaab is the forced indoctrination of their youth. Families are obliged, through the mediation of clan elders, to deliver sons to Al Shabaab seminars; after a rudimentary education many of these are then sent on to training camps. The boys are lost for years, until either the families receive a notification of their death, or their son comes back on leave, a successful fighter ready to found a family. The fear of losing one’s sons drives entire families to join the ranks of over 500,000 internally displaced persons on the outskirts of government-controlled cities.
 
Most Somalis also contest Al Shabaab’s claim to Islamic legitimacy. Not only because they kill other Muslims, with the takfiri justification that their opponents are apostates; also because their brand of Islam is not native to Somali culture but imported from the Gulf countries. Moreover, although the ban on plastic bags, cutting trees, chewing the drug ‘qat’ and smoking are generally seen as reasonable measures, the ban on the internet, music, TV and the lack of mobility to engage the world outside Al Shabaab areas is deeply resented.
 
Therefore, despite good indicators in some aspects of governance, Al Shabaab is rejected by the vast majority of Somalis, who rather live in anarchy then under such harsh rulers. There is no social contract underpinning the insurgents’ governance.
 
Federal non-governance
 
Al Shabaab’s governance track record stands in stark contrast to the multiple and repeated governance failures of the federal state supported by the international community. Despite sustained efforts by the federal government to turn external state-building blueprints into reality, Somalia’s state today remains incapable of providing basic services like health, education, water, power and infrastructure, even to the population of the capital city. The only service it provides is security in Mogadishu, but as frequent reports of terror attacks confirm, it is not doing very well on that account. The schools and hospitals that officially fall under the government are in fact entirely run by NGOs, whose ‘incentives’ replace salaries which are rarely paid. Residents must source all other services in the private sector, which in Somalia has been thriving despite state collapse.
 
The federal government’s dependence on international support makes it seem as a foreign project. Recent praise from the IMF for the Somali government’s reform process only increases the sense of alienation that Somalis feel toward their ‘state’. Estimates from 2016 show that 60% of government revenue came from foreign donations, and that 80% of that support was unaccounted for in the government’s books, meaning it was most likely embezzled or used to pay ‘off-budget’ projects such as buying votes. 
The government elected in 2017 seems genuinely concerned with fighting corruption, increasing transparency and instilling the principles of good governance, but its efforts remain mostly limited to paper, due to its lack of actual power. In Transparency International’s global index of perceptions of corruption Somalia remains the most corrupt country in the world. 
 
Direct international support to the federal government is dwarfed by other forms of international aid. For example, in 2018 1.1 billion USD was received through the UN appeal for humanitarian aid to Somalia, which is three times the budget of the Somali government (350 million USD). International support to Somali security forces is also expensive. Besides 3 billion Euros per year that the EU pays to African troop contributing countries for AMISOM, to fight Al Shabaab, a myriad of actors including the USA, the UK, the EU, Turkey, the UAE, Qatar have their own military or security programs in support of the Somali government (but not controlled by it). In contrast, Al Shabaab’s yearly budget is estimated at around 20 million USD.
 
The war
 
The federal government, supported by about 17,000 AMISOM troops plus additional troops from Kenya and Ethiopia not under AMISOM command, has been locked in a stalemate with Al Shabaab since 2014. Both sides suffer from overstretch; when they capture a new town or village, they often have trouble holding it. This stalemate has led international partners, foremost among whom the European Union which foots the bill, to work toward an exit strategy. This would see the Somali security forces gradually taking over from AMISOM. But as a recent report by a veteran military analyst shows, the considerable efforts to build up a national army since 2008 have not met success. One of the main issues is that commanders and their troops are not loyal to the federal state.
 
If neither side can defeat the other, the logical solution is a negotiated outcome. If the foreign, mostly Christian AMISOM troops withdraw, it would also remove one of the major claims to the militants’ legitimacy. Although Al Shabaab attacks on civilians are widely despised by Somalis, popular sympathy is aroused by the patriotic claims of the insurgents and their success in fighting against foreign troops. This is what caused Al Shabaab’s initial popularity, when it formed in 2007 to fight the Ethiopian invasion. The brutal drone war waged by the Trump administration against the insurgents is likewise winning them some sympathy.
 
A political settlement
 
Most external observers believe that the withdrawal of AMISOM would cause the Somali state to collapse, as it would tip the military balance decisively in Al Shabaab’s favour. However, Somalis I spoke to don’t agree. They point out that the population could deal with Al Shabaab. For the militants it would be difficult to justify operations against Somali clan-based troops, whether they fight for themselves or for the government, when these are not supported by foreign military. Rather than a new round of war, a ceasefire followed by negotiations would be the more likely outcome. An appeal to a negotiated outcome of the war with Al Shabaab was made by a senior Somali security analyst in the Guardian last October.
 
An essential part of the negotiations would be to arrive at a social contract among Somalis, which would lay the basis for the kind of state they want to create. This may not be the Western liberal democratic state, which is the only available template today, but which doesn’t seem to work in Somalia. This state would certainly be based on sharia (as is the current federal government) and it could include Al Shabaab’s models of local non-clan based and non-corrupt governance, its justice system and law and order enforcement capacity. To obtain legitimacy both in Somalia and beyond, the insurgents would have to commit to ending support to terrorist attacks outside Somalia and to cut their (already tenuous) ties with Al Qaeda.
 
In my recent two weeks of research in Mogadishu, I could not find a single Somali positive about the international intervention, even though I spoke to many whose livelihood was derived from external funding. The tens of billion dollars spent in Somalia over the past few years – including humanitarian aid – are not only wasted, but they fuel corruption and conflict. It would therefore be advisable for the entire international community to step aside and let Somalis sort out their own problems, allowing them to create a state that reflects their society and their vision of the future, certainly on good terms with the international community.

It’s been twelve months since Taliban fighters marched into the Afghan capital of Kabul, marking the end of a takeover that gripped the nation for several months. As foreign troops left, a new regime took power, forever changing the trajectory of not only Afghanistan, but the lives of millions of women living there.

Most reporting in this period painted Afghan women with a wide brush, projecting to the world that they are victims with limited agency, and that they all share the same fears about the Taliban government. This however is far from the truth. Today, many women are of course worried that the Taliban will continue to limit their political and social rights; but they are also concerned about the economy and deteriorating living conditions.

The individual voices of Afghan women are vital when developing strategies to address such a complicated humanitarian context like Afghanistan. I spoke with two Afghan women to share what life has been like for them under the new regime. Both women described fear and uncertainty–albeit from very different perspectives.

August 15, 2021, was an immensely painful day for both women, however the changes since then have impacted each differently. I was surprised to learn, for example, that a May 2022 decree issued by the Taliban requiring women to wear a burqa did not have a huge impact on either woman’s life, as they already wore a burqa under the previous regime.

Initially, Taliban leaders promised a government that would not seek to inhibit the rights of Afghan women, even releasing a decree that declared: “[a] woman is not a property, but a noble and free human being; no one can give her to anyone in exchange for peace...or to end animosity.

However, almost immediately after taking power, the Taliban closed domestic abuse shelters, leaving survivors of violence with no options for care. Female activists began to disappear, some taken from their homes, some turning up dead and others never heard from again. In March, Afghan girls turned up to schools to find the doors locked and guarded by armed men. Since then, girls above their sixth year of education have not been able to return to school (except those who attend private universities).

The Taliban’s May 2022 decree also urged women to refrain from leaving their homes, while those that did leave were required to be accompanied by a male relative or guardian (mahram). When adult male relatives are unavailable, mothers are reliant on young sons to escort them while walking outside. This practice of female seclusion is common in many parts of the country, but the Taliban’s decrees have turned cultural attitudes into law.

I spoke with Parisa,* a young university-educated woman from rural Nangarhar, who described her family as religious Pashtuns, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Parisa saw the Taliban takeover as an opportunity to end the financial and moral corruption of the previous government. However, she also viewed the group as harsh and intrusive. Like many Afghans I’ve spoken to, Parisa refers to the new regime as the “de facto government,” or simply the “Taliban.” (I have yet to encounter anyone who refers to their government using the Taliban’s preferred moniker: The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.)

Parisa’s sisters have been harassed several times while traveling to work, primary school, and university without a mahram. Her father, an educated man who worked with international organizations for decades, is now jobless. However the biggest change for Parisa has been the transformation of Kabul from a place where she could once live with some freedom to one where she constantly worries about the consequences of not abiding by government rules.

Since August 2021 Parisa has been subjected to numerous house searches at her home in Kabul because she lives alone as a single woman. During these searches she was threatened and refused the chance to cover up in front of men, in accordance with her religious principles.

Twelve months after the Taliban’s takeover, Parisa feels Afghanistan’s small educated population is being held in a cage, denied work and job opportunities, and targeted for their work history.

I also spoke with a young woman in Kabul named Fatima. Fatima requested that I use her real name, and seemed unfazed by security concerns. Fatima is a single woman like Parisa and comes from a Tajik family from the central-east province of Kapisa, but has lived in Kabul most of her life. Fatima was terrified of the Taliban as they approached Kabul. When she heard that the Taliban were arriving in the city, she began destroying documents that might be considered problematic, especially those that contain evidence of contacts or conversations with foreigners.

As the Taliban arrived in Kabul, Fatima went with her family to the city’s airport three or four times to try to find a way out of the country: she was sure that the new regime meant certain death. However, after their takeover, Fatima was surprised to find the Taliban engaging in what she described as “good behavior” and treating locals better than she expected.

Like Parisa and most other Afghan women, Fatima had been dressing according to Taliban standards for most of their lives, so she too was unaffected by the burqa mandate. What was new was the constant fear of doing something wrong, and the consequences this would bring to her family, who could be beaten, flogged or worse.

When asked about the biggest change in her life over the past year, Fatima answered quickly: the economy. She sees Afghan people around her losing their jobs and being unable to feed their families. She noted how the new government has failed to find any solutions and that the situation is deteriorating quickly. Looking ahead, Fatima feels that the future is unpredictable. The Taliban government has announced new initiatives to stimulate the economy, and Fatima hopes these will come to fruition. But she also fears they are empty promises.

Regardless of their different backgrounds, both Fatima and Parisa expressed concern and worry for what lies ahead. Parisa described her fellow Afghan women as brilliant and talented, but locked in a cage. When asked how she thought life would be a year from now, she was quick to answer: “things will not get better. They will be worse.” Fatima still clings to hope that the government will deliver a sustainable solution to the country’s economic turmoil, but she admits that the coming years are too uncertain to predict. However, both women agree that the government has so far failed to alleviate Afghan peoples’ fears for the future of their country.

*Name has been changed to protect the safety and security of the women we spoke with who requested anonymity."
